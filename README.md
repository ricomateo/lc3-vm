# lc3-vm
An implementation of the LC-3 VM in Rust.

This project has been developed based on the following guides
* [Write your Own Virtual Machine](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/#:lc3.c_2)
* [Letâ€™s build an LC-3 Virtual Machine](https://www.rodrigoaraujo.me/posts/lets-build-an-lc-3-virtual-machine/)


## Run an LC-3 program
Programs can be run executing `cargo run <program_name>.obj`.
This repo contains some games to try. These can be run with
* `cargo run 2048.obj` (You should press enter after the first line is printed)
* `cargo run rogue.obj`
